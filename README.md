# DEEP LEARNING AND COMPUTER VISION（2022 Fall）
## 1. half moon dataset classification
This is a simple toy dataset to visualize clustering and classification algorithms. We use single hidden layer neural network to classify the dataset. This neural network is also called multi-layer perception. Several activation functions like sigmoid and TanH are tested.

## 2. MNIST-GAN
Use Pytorch to build and train the MNIST-GAN network. This trained network can generate new handwritten digital pictures from 0 to 9. We tried to find out a generated picture which is closest to pictures in the training set. We also figured out how these digits were obtained by linearly interpolating between coordinates in z space of the full model.
