# DEEP LEARNING AND COMPUTER VISION（2022 Fall）
## 1. half moon dataset classification
This is a simple toy dataset to visualize clustering and classification algorithms. We use 
single hidden layer neural network to classify the dataset. This neural network is also called
multi-layer perception. Several activation functions like sigmoid and TanH are tested.

## 2. MNIST-GAN
